## GoogleMaps VS Mapbox

![vs](assets/vs.png)
This challenge is to compare two great technologies, on the left side we have a [google_maps_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/google_maps_flutter) of [Google](https://developers.google.com/maps) and on the right side a [mapbox_gl](https://pub.dev/packages/mapbox_gl)  of [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). These Flutter plugins allow you to display embedded, vector, interactive, and customizable maps within a Flutter widget, but we ask the question:
Up to what point?
